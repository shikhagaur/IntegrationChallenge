PART 1: Basic integration
------------------------------------------------
1. Basic integration files: AccuWeatherAccess.js, BigPandaAccess.js, server.js, readLocationsFromFile.js
2. locations.txt file has the list of locations for which weather data needs to be retrieved
3. readLocationsFromFile.js retrieves locations from locations.txt file
4. AccuWeatherAccess.js file has the code to call AccuWeather API with a GET request to retrieve weather data for supplied locations
5. Using server.js a localhost server (127.0.0.1:3000) can be made to run and the server calls AccuWeather API, sending to results to BigPandaAccess
6. BigPandaAccess.js has the code to send POST request to BigPanda API. This creates alerts in BigPanda.

In order to run the server using terminal,
1. navigate to the folder and type the below command:
node server.js
2. Open a web browser and type 127.0.0.1:3000

PART 2: Message queue
------------------------------------------------
1. RabbitMQ was used to create the message createQueue
2. RabbitMQ server was deployed on 127.0.0.1:5672
3. After installing the server, it was run using the command: rabbitmq-server
4. The file AccuWeatherToQueue.js connects to rabbitmq server running on localhost and creates a queue. It then sends the request to AccuWeather API and receives weather data.
5. The file receiveFromQueuePushToBigPanda.js 
In order to run the server using terminal,
1. Run RabbitMQ server using the command,
rabbitmq-server
2. In a separate terminal window type below to push weather data to queue,
./AccuWeatherToQueue.js
3. Type below to fetch the data from queue and send it to BigPanda:
./receiveFromQueuePushToBigPanda.js
